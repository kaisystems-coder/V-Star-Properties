/**
 * The shortlist — properties a visitor has saved.
 *
 * Every serious property site is built around this loop: browse, save a few,
 * come back to the shortlist. Compass and Zillow both hang their return visits
 * on it, and My Bunch of Keys named their whole brand after it ("My Bunch").
 * It is also the one feature an agency running off Instagram cannot offer at
 * all — a saved post is saved into Instagram, where the agent never sees it.
 *
 * Backed by localStorage rather than the sessionStorage the listings store
 * uses. The two have different lifetimes on purpose: listing edits are a
 * meeting's worth of demo state and should reset for the next prospect, but a
 * shortlist is the visitor's own and has to survive closing the tab. That is
 * the whole point of saving something.
 *
 * Stores ids only. The listing itself is looked up from the listings store, so
 * a saved property that is later edited or removed stays consistent.
